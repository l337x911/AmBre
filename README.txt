===========
AmBre: Primer designing and sequence analysis for amplification of breakpoints.
===========

AmBre is composed of two computational parts. A) Primer Designing
B) Long read sequence analysis.::

    python ambre_design.py <reference.fasta> <regions.txt> <temp_tag>
    python ambre_analyze.py <reference.fasta> <mapped_reads.sam>


Installation
=========

Software Requirements

For primer designing, the following software needs to be installed

* Primer3 Version 2.3.0 

* Blat Version 34x12

* Multiplx Version 1.2
